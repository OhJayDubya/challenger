# Challenger
Challenger is a simple web application written primarily in node, express, pug and mongoDB. The primary motivation behind this project is to create a fully functioning website with server-side technology, as well as cement my knowledge of NodeJS by working on the setup, developing and eventual deployment.

**DEVELOPMENT STATUS: ON HOLD**
I am currently looking to refactor the application this application in the future or potentially rebuild it. I feel during my initial development phase I attempted to incorporate to many elements around the actual challenger functionality and ended up making the development of the project as well as some of the code-base complicated.

In the future I would like to make at least these changes to have the application in a working state:
- Replace MongoDB with DynamoDB
- Possibly replace PassportJS with either AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) or roll my own
- Make user interaction more concise potentially removing reviews and challenge history
